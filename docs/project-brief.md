## Project Concept

### What are you building?

This website stands for the final course project for the Advanced Web Design subject. A fully built portfolio template, ready to be used by any creative professional or designer, developed with a clean and bold aesthetic and a strong focus on usability and performance.

### Who is it for?

The template has been exclusively designed under the idea of "from creatives to creatives".

### Why does it matter?

This template is designed to serve as a practical and customizable tool for creatives of all kinds. Simple yet thoughtfully crafted, it combines a clean structure with a unique, analog-inspired style. Every detail has been considered, ensuring a responsive experience, intuitive navigation and storytelling, and a clear strategy to stand out among the competence.

## Reflection Questions

### What challenges do you anticipate?

More than the design and programming process itself, I find the greatest challenge lies in those sections directly tied to highly technical, pure code concepts we had not previously worked with.

### How does this project connect to your learning goals?

It allows me to put into real practice everything we have learned in class. I have noticed that it has significantly helped me to visualize every stage of a web programming project: from the start to the final details and refinements ensuring that the site functions properly in all aspects (including accessibility, performance, and loading efficiency)
